Act as orchestrator. Do NOT write code directly.

## Task: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. Break task into sub-agent assignments
2. Specify boundaries for each agent
3. Coordinate parallel vs sequential
4. Synthesize results
5. Verify integration

## For Each Sub-Agent

- Clear objective
- Files owned
- Files NOT to touch
- Deliverables
